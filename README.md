# 🔐 Cyber Security Internship 
## Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the submission for **Task 1** of the Cyber Security Internship.  
The objective of this task is to build a **strong foundation in cyber security fundamentals** by understanding how digital systems are protected, how attackers think, and where security weaknesses commonly exist.

---

## 🎯 Objective of the Task
- To understand the **core principles of cyber security**
- To identify **different types of cyber attackers**
- To analyze **attack surfaces** in real-world applications
- To gain awareness of **OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities**
- To understand **how attacks can occur during application data flow**

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### 🔑 CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access  
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and not tampered with  
- **Availability** – Making sure systems and data are accessible when needed  

---

### 🧑‍💻 Types of Cyber Attackers
- Script Kiddies  
- Insiders  
- Hacktivists  
- Nation-State Attackers  

Each attacker type has different motivations, skill levels, and attack methods.

---

### 🌐 Attack Surface
An attack surface represents all possible points where an attacker can attempt to exploit a system.

**Examples of attack surfaces:**
- Web applications  
- Mobile applications  
- APIs  
- Networks (Wi-Fi, routers)  
- Cloud infrastructure  
- Databases  

---

### 🚨 OWASP Top 10 (Overview)
The OWASP Top 10 highlights the most critical web application security risks such as:
- SQL Injection  
- Broken Authentication  
- Security Misconfiguration  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  

Understanding these vulnerabilities helps in building and testing secure applications.

### 🔄 Application Data Flow & Attack Points


**Possible attack points:**
- User level – Phishing, malware  
- Application level – XSS, SQL Injection  
- Server level – Misconfiguration, remote code execution  
- Database level – Data breaches, unauthorized access
